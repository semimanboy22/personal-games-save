# Agar.io Prototype (local folder)

This folder now contains an offline single-player Agar-like prototype: `index.html` and `client.js`.

Run locally (no server required):

1. Open the folder `C:\repos\leerjaar-1\personal-games-made\agar.io` in your browser or open `index.html` directly.

2. The home screen lets you pick your name, color, game mode (FFA, Experimental, Battle Royale, Tag), and bot count. Click `Start Game` to begin.

Controls:
- Move mouse to aim.
- Press `Space` to split.

Notes:
- This version runs entirely in the browser, using simple AI bots for opponents.
- `server.js` still exists but is not required for offline play; you can delete it if you prefer a purely static folder.
